### Extension Modules

Three portable AI generation servers from [aivrar](https://github.com/aivrar):

| Extension | Port | Models | GPU |
|-----------|------|--------|-----|
| **[TTS Server](https://github.com/aivrar/portable-tts-server)** | 8200 | Kokoro, XTTS, Dia, Bark, Fish, + 5 more | 4 GB+ |
| **[Music Server](https://github.com/aivrar/portable-music-server)** | 9150 | MusicGen, Stable Audio, ACE-Step, Riffusion | 4 GB+ |
| **[ComfyUI](https://github.com/aivrar/comfyui-portable-installer)** | 5000 | SD 1.5, SDXL, Flux, 100+ registry models | 6 GB+ |

Each extension auto-installs on first use. No system dependencies.

### Workflow Engine
Chain tool calls into automated pipelines with data flow, conditions, loops, parallel execution, error handling, and cron scheduling.

### Dynamic Tool Maker
Create new tools at runtime — wrap any REST API or write custom Python handlers. Tools persist across sessions and reload automatically.

### Guided Mode
No API key? No problem. The chat works offline using a built-in 1,054-line user guide. New users get step-by-step guidance to set up their first AI model.

## Documentation

A searchable user guide is built into the agent — ask it anything or use the `search_guide` tool. The [PDF manual](https://github.com/aivrar/portable-hermes-agent/releases/latest) is included in every release.

Key topics: getting started, API setup, the interface, permissions, LM Studio local models, extensions (TTS/Music/ComfyUI), all 100 tools, custom tool creation, workflows, and a glossary of AI terms.
